SpiderBoard

This is the SpiderBoard project created by Fux0r777 in November 2025. 

SpiderBoard is a custom firmware project for an ESP32-based microcontroller. The goal is to provide a DIY IoT platform that is easy to use, reliable, and fully customizable. 

All design, firmware, and development ideas originate from the creator. This file serves as the initial documentation for the project i guess 🥰.
